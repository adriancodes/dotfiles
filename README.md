Structure
=========

This project contains my personal dotfiles collection. My primary machine is Mac OS X,
but most of this stuff should work equally well under Linux (with a few alias exceptions).

Changes
=======

I maintain a fork of Sorin Ionescu's [prezto](https://github.com/christianromney/prezto)
with my customizations.

For vim, I use the excellent [SPF-13](http://vim.spf13.com/) distro and
symlink the ```.vimrc.local``` and ```.vimrc.bundles.local``` files to my
home directory. 

The main difference between my setup and just about every other
Vimmer on the planet, is that I use ```"\<space>"``` as my ```<leader>```.

For most work, however, I rely on Emacs. While most Emacs gurus hate them, 
I find it easier to start with a curated starter kit like [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) 
and lay my customizations on top.

You'll probably learn more from looking at the above-referenced projects than my
idiosyncratic scripts, but one never knows so feel free to take whatever you like.
