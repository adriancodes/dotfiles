# my own homebrew external command for managing
# a list of brews and casks via state files
#
# the premise is that two files .brews and .casks
# which are version-controlled and symlinked under $HOME
# contain the list of brews and casks I want installed 
# on my machine. If I need to re-build or migrate a
# machine I can checkout my dotfiles and issue
# a single command to install all the brews and casks
# listed in these files.
#
# really it's a lightweight (read: shitty) version of 
# Chef or Puppet without installing all that sowftware
#
# commands: 
#   brew mix (brew|cask) <formula>   - adds a new brew/cask to the list
#   brew unmix (brew|cask) <formula> - removes a new brew/cask
#   brew drink                       - installs everything in the lists (that isn't already)
