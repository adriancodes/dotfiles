      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups start-rolling-update - starts a new
         rolling update

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups start-rolling-update GROUP
         [--api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--max-num-concurrent-instances MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_INSTANCES]
         [--num-canary-instances NUM_CANARY_INSTANCES] [--project PROJECT]
         [--quiet, -q]
         [--sleep-after-instance-restart SLEEP_AFTER_INSTANCE_RESTART]
         --template TEMPLATE [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      A rolling update causes the service to gradually recreate your existing
      instances with the new template. You can increase the number of instances
      updated simultaneously with the --max-num-concurrent-instances flag.

      If you are not sure you want to apply an update to all existing instances,
      you can use the --num-canary-instances flag and the update will
      automatically be paused after updating the number of instances specified.
      Afterwards, you can decide whether to cancel or continue the update.

      In case you notice your managed instance group misbehaving due to the new
      template, you can roll back the update. This will stop the update from
      being applied to more instances, and instances already created with the
      new template will be recreated with the last template applied before the
      current update.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      GROUP

         Managed instance group name.

FLAGS

      --max-num-concurrent-instances MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_INSTANCES

      --num-canary-instances NUM_CANARY_INSTANCES

         Number of instances updated as a part of canary phase.

      --sleep-after-instance-restart SLEEP_AFTER_INSTANCE_RESTART

         Time period after the instance has been restarted but before marking
         the update of this instance as done. Valid units for this flag are s
         for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours and d for days. If no unit is
         specified, seconds is assumed.

      --api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"

         Optional API version.

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
