NAME

      gcloud preview deployment-manager templates create - insert (Create) a
         template resource

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview deployment-manager templates create TEMPLATE
         [--api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--project PROJECT] [--quiet, -q]
         --template-file TEMPLATE_FILE [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command inserts (creates) a template resource.

      You must provide a relative path to a local template file, either in YAML
      or JSON format, to create a template resource.

      If you want to use actions in your template, you can use a combination of
      script files and commands to specify your actions. In some cases, you
      might want to group a number of related commands into a script file for
      organization and readability reasons.

      To include a local script file, use the %file prefix in front of your
      script file's path. For example, if you specify the following in your
      template:

        actions:
          install-apache:
            commands: [
              "apt-get update",
              "apt-get -y install apache2",
              "%file:/path/to/my/website-setup-script.sh"
            ]

      the third command would copy the contents of the local file
      /path/to/my/website-setup-script.sh to a file on your Compute Engine
      virtual machines, and execute that file. For more information, please see
      https://developers.google.com/deployment-manager/yaml#includes

      Please note that each command or %file entry in your template must be less
      than 32KB in size, and the aggregate size of all of your commands must be
      less than 512KB.
