NAME

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups delete-instances - deletes one or
         more instances from a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups delete-instances GROUP
         [--api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] --instance INSTANCE [INSTANCE ...] [--project PROJECT]
         [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command deletes one or more instances from a managed instance group.
      Once the instances have finished deleting, the size of the group is
      automatically reduced to reflect the changes.

      If you would like to keep the underlying virtual machines but still remove
      them from the managed instance group, use the abandon-instances command
      instead.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      GROUP

         Managed instance group name.

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific

         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
