NAME

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups abandon-instances - abandons one or
         more instances from a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups abandon-instances GROUP
         [--api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] --instance INSTANCE [INSTANCE ...] [--project PROJECT]
         [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command abandons one or more instances from a managed instance group,
      thereby reducing the intendedSize of the group. Once the instances have
      been abandoned, the currentSize of the group is automatically reduced as
      well to reflect the changes.

      If you would like to delete the underlying virtual machines instead of
      only moving them out of the managed instance group, use the
      delete-instances command instead.

         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.
