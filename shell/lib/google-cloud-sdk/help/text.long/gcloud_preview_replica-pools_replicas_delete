SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview replica-pools replicas delete REPLICA [--abandon-instance]

DESCRIPTION

      This command deletes a single replica from a replica pool.

      By default, deleting a replica also deletes the underlying virtual machine
      instance. To keep the virtual machine instance, but delete the replica,
      provide the --abandon-instance flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      REPLICA

         Replica name.

FLAGS

      --abandon-instance

         If provided, abandon the instance: leave the instance behind and delete
         the Replica. Instance is deleted along with the Replica if this flag is
         not provided.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta1"

         Optional API version.

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
