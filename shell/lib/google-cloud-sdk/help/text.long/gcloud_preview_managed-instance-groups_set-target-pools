NAME

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups set-target-pools - sets the target
         pools for an existing managed instance group

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups set-target-pools GROUP
         [--api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--project PROJECT] [--quiet, -q]
         --target-pool TARGET_POOL [TARGET_POOL ...] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command sets the target pools for an existing managed instance group.

      The new target pools won't apply to existing instances in the group unless
      they are recreated using the recreate-instances command. But any new
      instances created in the managed instance group will be added to all of
      the provided target pools for load balancing purposes.

         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
