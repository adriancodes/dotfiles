DESCRIPTION

      This command deletes a managed instance group and all of the instances in
      the group.

      The underlying virtual machine instances are also deleted. If you wish to
      keep one or more of the virtual machines, use the abandon-instances
      command first before deleting the managed instance group.

         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
