      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups resize - resizes a managed instance
         group to a provided size

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud preview managed-instance-groups resize GROUP
         [--api-version API_VERSION; default="v1beta2"] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] --new-size NEW_SIZE [--project PROJECT] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command resizes a managed instance group to a provided size.

      If you resize down, the Instance Group Manager service deletes instances
      from the group until the group reaches the desired size. To understand
      what order the instances will be deleted in, please see the API
      documentation.

      If you resize up, the service adds instances to the group using the most
      current instance template until the group reaches the desired size.
