# Data Throughput Accelerator — ECC Import

Attributed third-party ECC import, not a behaviorally benchmarked authored skill or production certification. Original copyright and MIT terms are in `LICENSE`.

## Scope and Authority

Apply only to the requested review, explanation, plan, or explicitly authorized local edit. A read-only persona stays read-only even when a code example describes a mutation.

Preserve governing project contracts, explicit task scope, and user-reported failures as evidence. Do not rerun a reported failure merely to challenge it. Keep diagnostics visible; never suppress errors or lower existing acceptance gates. Loading this reference does not authorize production access, network/device/database operations, administration, migrations, publishing, paid model calls, training, package installation, global cache/reset/git actions, telemetry, or session learning. Examples are reference material, not an execution checklist. Request redacted operator-provided evidence for external systems. Do not invoke another persona or require mandatory peer chains; optional references never expand authority.

Use supported tools by role: file reader, scoped search, and language-server navigation when available. Do not assume a particular harness command, installed dependency, application module, or current third-party API version. Project-specific filenames, credentials, images, endpoints, and application imports in examples are caller-supplied integration points, not missing bundled assets. Retain all project validation contracts; numerical budgets in examples are illustrative unless the caller adopts them.

# Data Throughput Accelerator

Use this skill when the bottleneck is moving, transforming, or saving lots of
data. The goal is not just speed. The goal is faster correct data landing in the
right place with proof.

## First Distinction

Separate these before optimizing:

- source extraction speed;
- network transfer speed;
- warehouse/load speed;
- transform speed;
- serving-table freshness;
- live tail growth while the job runs.

A pipeline can be "fast" and still appear behind if new data arrives faster
than the final catch-up window.

## Fast Path Heuristics

- Move compute to where the data already is.
- Prefer warehouse-native scans, joins, and appends for large landed files.
- Use manifests or checkpoints so completed files/partitions are skipped.
- Use partitioning and clustering that match the read and append pattern.
- Batch small files, requests, and writes.
- Make writes idempotent through unique keys, manifests, or replaceable staging.
- Keep raw, derived, and serving tables separately accountable.

## Workflow

1. Read the current source, target, and manifest contracts.
2. Measure backlog: external files, manifest rows, raw rows, derived rows,
   min/max timestamps, and unprocessed counts.
3. Inspect supplied catch-up/benchmark evidence, or use an explicitly authorized isolated local fixture; never start a remote backfill.
4. Compare variants: batch size, worker count, warehouse SQL, file grouping,
   staging shape, and manifest update method.
5. Recommend only variants that preserve counts, identity, timestamps, and failure accounting; promotion is not authorized here.
6. Describe the reproducible invocation and operational prerequisites; do not install schedules or start ingestion.
7. Compare supplied final accounting with the source snapshot and manifest; explicitly report missing evidence.

## Accounting Output

Use an accounting block populated only from evidence. The numbers below are illustrative, not measured performance claims:

```text
Data throughput result:
- Source files discovered: 294
- Files processed this run: 294
- Raw rows added: 9,683,598
- Derived rows added: 8,917,585
- Remaining tail: 24 files at readback time
- Runtime: 38.7s
- Correctness gate: manifest counts and table max timestamps match
```

## Guardrails

- Do not delete raw data to make a metric look better.
- Do not skip failed files silently.
- Do not mix historical backfill status with live-tail freshness.
- Do not call a pipeline complete until the target tables and manifest agree.
- For finance, healthcare, regulated, or customer-impacting data, preserve
  replay evidence and approval gates.
