# Homelab Wireguard Vpn — ECC Import

Attributed third-party ECC import, not a behaviorally benchmarked authored skill or production certification. Original copyright and MIT terms are in `LICENSE`.

## Scope and Authority

Apply only to the requested review, explanation, plan, or explicitly authorized local edit. A read-only persona stays read-only even when a code example describes a mutation.

Preserve governing project contracts, explicit task scope, and user-reported failures as evidence. Do not rerun a reported failure merely to challenge it. Keep diagnostics visible; never suppress errors or lower existing acceptance gates. Loading this reference does not authorize production access, network/device/database operations, administration, migrations, publishing, paid model calls, training, package installation, global cache/reset/git actions, telemetry, or session learning. Examples are reference material, not an execution checklist. Request redacted operator-provided evidence for external systems. Do not invoke another persona or require mandatory peer chains; optional references never expand authority.

Use supported tools by role: file reader, scoped search, and language-server navigation when available. Do not assume a particular harness command, installed dependency, application module, or current third-party API version. Project-specific filenames, credentials, images, endpoints, and application imports in examples are caller-supplied integration points, not missing bundled assets. Retain all project validation contracts; numerical budgets in examples are illustrative unless the caller adopts them.

# Homelab WireGuard VPN

WireGuard is a fast, modern VPN protocol. It is the right choice for remote access to a
home network — simpler to configure than OpenVPN and faster than most alternatives.

All configuration examples show common setups. Review each command — especially the
iptables forwarding rules and key file permissions — before applying them to your
system, and make changes in a maintenance window.

## When to Use

- Setting up WireGuard server on a Raspberry Pi, Linux host, pfSense, or router
- Generating WireGuard keypairs and writing peer config files
- Configuring remote access from a phone or laptop to a home network
- Explaining split tunneling (route only home traffic) vs full tunnel (route all traffic)
- Troubleshooting WireGuard connections that will not come up
- Automating peer configuration generation for multiple clients

## How WireGuard Works

```
Your phone (WireGuard client)
    │
    │  Encrypted UDP tunnel (port 51820)
    │
Your home router (WireGuard server — needs a public IP or DDNS)
    │
    Your home network (192.168.1.0/24, NAS, Pi, etc.)

Every device has a keypair (public + private key).
The server knows each client's public key.
The client knows the server's public key + endpoint (IP:port).
Traffic is encrypted end-to-end with no central server or certificate authority.
```

## Server Setup (Linux)

```bash
# Install WireGuard
# Installation is a separately authorized operator prerequisite; use the OS-supported WireGuard package.

# Generate server keypair — create files with private permissions from the start
sudo mkdir -p /etc/wireguard
sudo sh -c 'umask 077; wg genkey > /etc/wireguard/server_private.key'
sudo sh -c 'wg pubkey < /etc/wireguard/server_private.key > /etc/wireguard/server_public.key'

# Write server config — substitute the actual private key value
# Do not store private keys in version control or share them
sudo tee /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf << 'EOF'
[Interface]
Address = 10.8.0.1/24              # VPN subnet — server gets .1
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = <paste_server_private_key_here>

# Scoped forwarding rules: allow VPN traffic in/out, not a blanket FORWARD ACCEPT
PostUp   = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
PostUp   = iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wg0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
PostUp   = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i eth0 -o wg0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

[Peer]
# Phone — replace with the actual phone public key
PublicKey = <phone_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.8.0.2/32

[Peer]
# Laptop — replace with the actual laptop public key
PublicKey = <laptop_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.8.0.3/32
EOF
sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

# Replace eth0 with your actual outbound interface name
# Check with: ip route show default

# Enable IP forwarding (required for routing traffic through the server)
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-wireguard.conf
sudo sysctl --system

# Start WireGuard and enable on boot
sudo wg-quick up wg0
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

## Client Configuration

```bash
# Generate a unique keypair for each client device
# Run on the client, or on the server and transfer the private key securely — never in plaintext
umask 077
wg genkey | tee phone_private.key | wg pubkey > phone_public.key

# Client config file (phone_wg0.conf):
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <phone_private_key>
Address = 10.8.0.2/32
DNS = 192.168.1.2                  # Optional: use Pi-hole for DNS over the tunnel

[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
Endpoint = your-home-ip.ddns.net:51820  # Your public IP or DDNS hostname
AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.0/24            # Split tunnel: only home network traffic
# AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0        # Full tunnel requires separate working IPv6 addressing/routing/firewall policy.

PersistentKeepalive = 25              # Optional NAT keepalive when inbound reachability across idle mappings is needed.
```

## Split Tunnel vs Full Tunnel

```
# Split tunnel: AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.0/24
  Only traffic destined for your home network goes through the VPN.
  Internet traffic (YouTube, Spotify) goes directly — better performance on mobile.
  Best for: "I just want to reach my NAS and Pi from anywhere."

# Full tunnel: AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
  ALL traffic goes through your home internet connection.
  Useful for: piggybacking home DNS/Pi-hole ad blocking.
  Downside: home upload speed becomes your bottleneck everywhere.

# Multi-subnet split tunnel (most common homelab use case):
  AllowedIPs = 192.168.10.0/24, 192.168.20.0/24, 192.168.30.0/24, 10.8.0.0/24
  Routes all your VLANs through the tunnel; internet stays direct.
```

## Key Generation and Peer Management

```python
import subprocess

def generate_keypair() -> tuple[str, str]:
    """Generate a WireGuard keypair. Returns (private_key, public_key)."""
    private = subprocess.check_output(["wg", "genkey"]).decode().strip()
    public = subprocess.run(
        ["wg", "pubkey"], input=private.encode(), capture_output=True, check=True
    ).stdout.decode().strip()
    return private, public

def generate_preshared_key() -> str:
    return subprocess.check_output(["wg", "genpsk"]).decode().strip()

def build_client_config(
    client_private_key: str,
    client_vpn_ip: str,       # e.g. "10.8.0.3"
    server_public_key: str,
    server_endpoint: str,     # e.g. "home.example.com:51820"
    allowed_ips: str = "192.168.1.0/24",
    dns: str = "",
) -> str:
    dns_line = f"DNS = {dns}\n" if dns else ""
    return f"""[Interface]
PrivateKey = {client_private_key}
Address = {client_vpn_ip}/32
{dns_line}
[Peer]
PublicKey = {server_public_key}
Endpoint = {server_endpoint}
AllowedIPs = {allowed_ips}
PersistentKeepalive = 25
"""

def build_server_peer_block(
    client_public_key: str,
    client_vpn_ip: str,
    comment: str = "",
) -> str:
    comment_line = f"# {comment}\n" if comment else ""
    return f"""
{comment_line}[Peer]
PublicKey = {client_public_key}
AllowedIPs = {client_vpn_ip}/32
"""
```

Keep private keys out of source control. If you use this script, write key material
to files with mode 600 and never log or print it.

## pfSense / OPNsense WireGuard

```
# pfSense: VPN → WireGuard → Add Tunnel
  Interface Keys: Generate (creates keypair automatically)
  Listen Port: 51820
  Interface Address: 10.8.0.1/24

# Add Peer (one per client):
  Public Key: <client public key>
  Allowed IPs: 10.8.0.2/32

# Assign the WireGuard interface:
  Interfaces → Assignments → Add (select wg0)
  Enable interface, no IP needed (it is set in the tunnel config)

# Firewall rules:
  WAN → Allow UDP port 51820 inbound (so clients can reach the server)
  WireGuard interface → Allow traffic to LAN networks you want reachable
```

## DDNS and Reachability

DDNS updates a changing public endpoint; it does not overcome carrier-grade NAT or inbound filtering. Inspect the actual ISP/public-address contract before proposing remote access.

Choose an approved DDNS client/version and its documented credential schema. Use least-privilege zone credentials in a private secret store and expose update failures without leaking tokens. Do not create an account, schedule a job, install a updater, or call the provider automatically. A DDNS response is not proof that the VPN endpoint is reachable.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check WireGuard status and last handshake
sudo wg show

# If "latest handshake" is never or very old, the tunnel is not connected.
# Check:
# 1. Is UDP port 51820 open on the router/firewall?
sudo ufw status  # or check pfSense/UniFi firewall rules

# 2. Is the server public key in the client config correct?
sudo wg show wg0 public-key   # Compare to what is in the client config

# 3. Is IP forwarding enabled on the server?
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  # Should be 1

# 4. Does the client AllowedIPs cover the IP you are trying to reach?
# If AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.0/24 and you are trying to reach 192.168.3.5, it will not route.

# Check kernel logs for WireGuard errors
dmesg | grep wireguard

# Restart WireGuard
sudo wg-quick down wg0 && sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

## Anti-Patterns

```
# BAD: Storing private keys in version control or sharing them
# Private keys are equivalent to passwords — never commit them to git

# BAD: Using AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 on mobile without considering the impact
# Full tunnel routes all mobile traffic through your home upload — usually slow

# BAD: Not setting PersistentKeepalive on mobile clients
# Mobile clients behind NAT drop idle tunnels without it

# BAD: Opening port 51820 in the firewall but forgetting IP forwarding on the server
# Tunnel connects but no traffic routes — confusing to debug

# BAD: Sharing a keypair across multiple client devices
# Each device must have its own unique keypair — shared keys break the security model

# BAD: Using a broad "FORWARD ACCEPT" iptables rule
# Scope forwarding rules to the wg0 interface and direction only
```

## Best Practices

- Generate a unique keypair per client device — never reuse keys
- Use split tunneling (`AllowedIPs = <home subnets>`) for mobile
- Use keepalive only where NAT mapping behavior requires it; account for mobile battery use
- Use DDNS if your ISP assigns a dynamic IP; store credentials in env files, not inline
- Use scoped iptables forwarding rules (inbound on wg0 only) rather than a blanket FORWARD ACCEPT
- Add Pi-hole's IP as `DNS =` in client configs to get ad blocking over the VPN
- Rotate the server keypair periodically and update all client configs
