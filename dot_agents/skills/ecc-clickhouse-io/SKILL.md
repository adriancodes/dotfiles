# Clickhouse Io — ECC Import

Attributed third-party ECC import, not a behaviorally benchmarked authored skill or production certification. Original copyright and MIT terms are in `LICENSE`.

## Scope and Authority

Apply only to the requested review, explanation, plan, or explicitly authorized local edit. A read-only persona stays read-only even when a code example describes a mutation.

Preserve governing project contracts, explicit task scope, and user-reported failures as evidence. Do not rerun a reported failure merely to challenge it. Keep diagnostics visible; never suppress errors or lower existing acceptance gates. Loading this reference does not authorize production access, network/device/database operations, administration, migrations, publishing, paid model calls, training, package installation, global cache/reset/git actions, telemetry, or session learning. Examples are reference material, not an execution checklist. Request redacted operator-provided evidence for external systems. Do not invoke another persona or require mandatory peer chains; optional references never expand authority.

Use supported tools by role: file reader, scoped search, and language-server navigation when available. Do not assume a particular harness command, installed dependency, application module, or current third-party API version. Project-specific filenames, credentials, images, endpoints, and application imports in examples are caller-supplied integration points, not missing bundled assets. Retain all project validation contracts; numerical budgets in examples are illustrative unless the caller adopts them.

# ClickHouse Analytics Patterns

ClickHouse-specific patterns for high-performance analytics and data engineering.

## When to Activate

- Designing ClickHouse table schemas (MergeTree engine selection)
- Writing analytical queries (aggregations, window functions, joins)
- Optimizing query performance (partition pruning, projections, materialized views)
- Ingesting large volumes of data (batch inserts, Kafka integration)
- Migrating from PostgreSQL/MySQL to ClickHouse for analytics
- Implementing real-time dashboards or time-series analytics

## Overview

ClickHouse is a column-oriented database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing (OLAP). It's optimized for fast analytical queries on large datasets.

**Key Features:**
- Column-oriented storage
- Data compression
- Parallel query execution
- Distributed queries
- Real-time analytics

## Table Design Patterns

### MergeTree Engine (Most Common)

```sql
CREATE TABLE markets_analytics (
    date Date,
    market_id String,
    market_name String,
    volume UInt64,
    trades UInt32,
    unique_traders UInt32,
    avg_trade_size Float64,
    created_at DateTime
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date)
ORDER BY (date, market_id)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

### ReplacingMergeTree (Eventual Deduplication)

```sql
-- Deduplication uses the complete ORDER BY key within a partition during merges.\n-- This schema collapses only rows with identical user_id, event_id, and timestamp.\n-- Changed timestamps remain separate rows; choose stable identity/version keys for updates.
CREATE TABLE user_events (
    event_id String,
    user_id String,
    event_type String,
    timestamp DateTime,
    properties String
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(timestamp)
ORDER BY (user_id, event_id, timestamp)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, event_id);
```

### AggregatingMergeTree (Pre-aggregation)

```sql
-- For maintaining aggregated metrics
CREATE TABLE market_stats_hourly (
    hour DateTime,
    market_id String,
    total_volume AggregateFunction(sum, UInt64),
    total_trades AggregateFunction(count),
    unique_users AggregateFunction(uniq, String)
) ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(hour)
ORDER BY (hour, market_id);

-- Query aggregated data
SELECT
    hour,
    market_id,
    sumMerge(total_volume) AS volume,
    countMerge(total_trades) AS trades,
    uniqMerge(unique_users) AS users
FROM market_stats_hourly
WHERE hour >= toStartOfHour(now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY hour, market_id
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

## Query Optimization Patterns

### Efficient Filtering

```sql
-- Include predicates that permit partition and ordering-key pruning.
SELECT *
FROM markets_analytics
WHERE date >= '2025-01-01'
  AND market_id = 'market-123'
  AND volume > 1000
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Potentially expensive broad text filtering; textual predicate order is not the cause.
SELECT *
FROM markets_analytics
WHERE volume > 1000
  AND market_name LIKE '%election%'
  AND date >= '2025-01-01';
```

### Aggregations

```sql
-- PASS: GOOD: Use ClickHouse-specific aggregation functions
SELECT
    toStartOfDay(created_at) AS day,
    market_id,
    sum(volume) AS total_volume,
    count() AS total_trades,
    uniq(trader_id) AS unique_traders,
    avg(trade_size) AS avg_size
FROM trades
WHERE created_at >= today() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY day, market_id
ORDER BY day DESC, total_volume DESC;

-- Approximate quantiles: choose exact/approximate algorithms and error tolerance deliberately.
SELECT
    quantile(0.50)(trade_size) AS median,
    quantile(0.95)(trade_size) AS p95,
    quantile(0.99)(trade_size) AS p99
FROM trades
WHERE created_at >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

### Window Functions

```sql
-- Calculate running totals
SELECT
    date,
    market_id,
    volume,
    sum(volume) OVER (
        PARTITION BY market_id
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_volume
FROM markets_analytics
WHERE date >= today() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
ORDER BY market_id, date;
```

## Data Insertion Patterns

### Bulk Insert (Recommended)

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@clickhouse/client'

const clickhouse = createClient({
  url: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_URL ?? 'http://localhost:8123',
  username: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_USER,
  password: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD
})

// PASS: Batch insert (efficient)
async function bulkInsertTrades(trades: Trade[]) {
  await clickhouse.insert({
    table: 'trades',
    values: trades.map(trade => ({
      id: trade.id,
      market_id: trade.market_id,
      user_id: trade.user_id,
      amount: trade.amount,
      timestamp: trade.timestamp.toISOString()
    })),
    format: 'JSONEachRow'
  })
}

// FAIL: Individual inserts (slow)
async function insertTrade(trade: Trade) {
  // Don't do this in a loop!
  await clickhouse.insert({
    table: 'trades',
    values: [{
      id: trade.id,
      market_id: trade.market_id,
      user_id: trade.user_id,
      amount: trade.amount,
      timestamp: trade.timestamp.toISOString()
    }],
    format: 'JSONEachRow'
  })
}
```

### Streaming Insert

```typescript
// For continuous data ingestion
import { Readable } from 'node:stream'

async function streamInserts(dataSource: AsyncIterable<Record<string, unknown>>) {
  await clickhouse.insert({
    table: 'trades',
    values: Readable.from(dataSource, { objectMode: true }),
    format: 'JSONEachRow'
  })
}
```

## Materialized Views

### Real-time Aggregations

```sql
-- Create materialized view for hourly stats
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW market_stats_hourly_mv
TO market_stats_hourly
AS SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) AS hour,
    market_id,
    sumState(amount) AS total_volume,
    countState() AS total_trades,
    uniqState(user_id) AS unique_users
FROM trades
GROUP BY hour, market_id;

-- Query the materialized view
SELECT
    hour,
    market_id,
    sumMerge(total_volume) AS volume,
    countMerge(total_trades) AS trades,
    uniqMerge(unique_users) AS users
FROM market_stats_hourly
WHERE hour >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY hour, market_id;
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Query Performance

```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT
    query_id,
    user,
    query,
    query_duration_ms,
    read_rows,
    read_bytes,
    memory_usage
FROM system.query_log
WHERE type = 'QueryFinish'
  AND query_duration_ms > 1000
  AND event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY query_duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Table Statistics

```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) AS size,
    sum(rows) AS rows,
    max(modification_time) AS latest_modification
FROM system.parts
WHERE active
GROUP BY database, table
ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC;
```

## Common Analytics Queries

### Time Series Analysis

```sql
-- Daily active users
SELECT
    toDate(timestamp) AS date,
    uniq(user_id) AS daily_active_users
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= today() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

-- Retention analysis
SELECT
    signup_date,
    uniqExactIf(user_id, days_since_signup = 0) AS day_0,
    uniqExactIf(user_id, days_since_signup = 1) AS day_1,
    uniqExactIf(user_id, days_since_signup = 7) AS day_7,
    uniqExactIf(user_id, days_since_signup = 30) AS day_30
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        min(toDate(timestamp)) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS signup_date,
        toDate(timestamp) AS activity_date,
        dateDiff('day', signup_date, activity_date) AS days_since_signup
    FROM events
    GROUP BY user_id, activity_date
)
GROUP BY signup_date
ORDER BY signup_date DESC;
```

### Funnel Analysis

Use ordered session progress rather than dividing event counts, which can include repeats and out-of-order events:

```sql
SELECT
    countIf(level >= 1) AS viewed,
    countIf(level >= 2) AS clicked,
    countIf(level >= 3) AS completed,
    round(100.0 * clicked / nullIf(viewed, 0), 2) AS view_to_click_rate,
    round(100.0 * completed / nullIf(clicked, 0), 2) AS click_to_completion_rate
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, session_id,
        windowFunnel(3600)(
            timestamp,
            event_type = 'viewed_market',
            event_type = 'clicked_trade',
            event_type = 'completed_trade'
        ) AS level
    FROM events
    WHERE toDate(timestamp) = today()
    GROUP BY user_id, session_id
);
```

The one-hour window and day filter are illustrative. Define session crossing, equal-timestamp behavior, and observation completeness before using the rates for decisions.

### Cohort Analysis

```sql
-- User cohorts by signup month
SELECT
    toStartOfMonth(signup_date) AS cohort,
    toStartOfMonth(activity_date) AS month,
    dateDiff('month', cohort, month) AS months_since_signup,
    count(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        min(toDate(timestamp)) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS signup_date,
        toDate(timestamp) AS activity_date
    FROM events
)
GROUP BY cohort, month, months_since_signup
ORDER BY cohort, months_since_signup;
```

## Data Pipeline Patterns

### ETL Pattern

```typescript
// Extract, Transform, Load
async function etlPipeline() {
  // 1. Extract from source
  const rawData = await extractFromPostgres()

  // 2. Transform
  const transformed = rawData.map(row => ({
    date: new Date(row.created_at).toISOString().split('T')[0],
    market_id: row.market_slug,
    volume: parseFloat(row.total_volume),
    trades: parseInt(row.trade_count)
  }))

  // 3. Load to ClickHouse
  await bulkInsertToClickHouse(transformed)
}

// Invocation/scheduling is outside this reference. A real job needs bounded batches,\n// durable checkpoints, idempotent writes, failure accounting, and no overlapping runs.
```

### Change Data Capture (CDC)

PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY` is an ephemeral notification mechanism, not durable CDC. Notifications can be lost during disconnects and are not a replay log.

For durable replication, review a supported logical-decoding/CDC connector with:

- an explicit source snapshot boundary and durable WAL/offset checkpoint;
- schema mapping and version handling;
- idempotent destination keys and update/delete semantics;
- bounded batching/backpressure and lag accounting;
- recovery evidence showing reconnect/replay does not lose or double-count data.

If notifications are used only to wake a poller, let the poller read a durable outbox or sequence cursor and acknowledge progress after the destination write succeeds. Do not create subscriptions, start a listener, or launch ingestion from this skill.

## Best Practices

### 1. Partitioning Strategy
- Partition by time (usually month or day)
- Avoid too many partitions (performance impact)
- Use DATE type for partition key

### 2. Ordering Key
- Put most frequently filtered columns first
- Balance common equality/range predicates and compression; low-cardinality leading keys often help, but workload evidence decides the ordering.
- Order impacts compression

### 3. Data Types
- Use smallest appropriate type (UInt32 vs UInt64)
- Use LowCardinality for repeated strings
- Use Enum for categorical data

### 4. Avoid
- SELECT * (specify columns)
- Blanket `FINAL` avoidance: some correctness contracts require query-time deduplication; evaluate scoped `FINAL` or explicit version aggregation rather than forcing expensive merges.
- Too many JOINs (denormalize for analytics)
- Small frequent inserts (batch instead)

### 5. Monitoring
- Track query performance
- Monitor disk usage
- Check merge operations
- Review slow query log

**Remember**: ClickHouse excels at analytical workloads. Design tables for your query patterns, batch inserts, and leverage materialized views for real-time aggregations.
