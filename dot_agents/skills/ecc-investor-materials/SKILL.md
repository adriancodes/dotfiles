# Investor Materials

Build investor-facing materials that are consistent, credible, and easy to defend.

## Local scope and prerequisites

Use confirmed company facts and explicit financial assumptions supplied by the user or supported by authorized sources. Missing metrics are blockers or labeled assumptions, not fabricated traction. Text drafts need no account connection; spreadsheet, slide, or PDF outputs require an available authoring/export tool. State unavailable output formats. Installation does not submit applications, share confidential materials, move money, or change financing terms.

## When to Activate

- creating or revising a pitch deck
- writing an investor memo or one-pager
- building a financial model, milestone plan, or use-of-funds table
- answering accelerator or incubator application questions
- aligning multiple fundraising docs around one source of truth

## Golden Rule

All investor materials must agree with each other.

Create or confirm a single source of truth before writing:
- traction metrics
- pricing and revenue assumptions
- raise size and instrument
- use of funds
- team bios and titles
- milestones and timelines

If conflicting numbers appear, stop and resolve them before drafting.

## Core Workflow

1. inventory the canonical facts
2. identify missing assumptions
3. choose the asset type
4. draft the asset with explicit logic
5. cross-check every number against the source of truth

## Asset Guidance

### Pitch Deck
Recommended flow:
1. company + wedge
2. problem
3. solution
4. product / demo
5. market
6. business model
7. traction
8. team
9. competition / differentiation
10. ask
11. use of funds / milestones
12. appendix

If the user wants a web-native deck, optionally pair this skill with `ecc-frontend-slides`; without it, retain the deck narrative above and generate semantic, responsive HTML only if the requested browser authoring and verification capabilities are available. Otherwise deliver the complete slide content and state the rendering prerequisite.

### One-Pager / Memo
- state what the company does in one clean sentence
- show why now
- include traction and proof points early
- make the ask precise
- keep claims easy to verify

### Financial Model
Include:
- explicit assumptions
- bear / base / bull cases when useful
- clean layer-by-layer revenue logic
- milestone-linked spending
- sensitivity analysis where the decision hinges on assumptions

### Accelerator Applications
- answer the exact question asked
- prioritize traction, insight, and team advantage
- avoid puffery
- keep internal metrics consistent with the deck and model

## Red Flags to Avoid

- unverifiable claims
- fuzzy market sizing without assumptions
- inconsistent team roles or titles
- revenue math that does not sum cleanly
- inflated certainty where assumptions are fragile

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- every number matches the current source of truth
- use of funds and revenue layers sum correctly
- assumptions are visible, not buried
- the story is clear without hype language
- the final asset is defensible in a partner meeting
